# RamenShop

This is a game about selling ramen.

Customers come, buy ramen, give money, I use money to upgrade, sell more ramen, and travel to new locations. It is a basic concept, but I have a lot of exciting ideas to implement.

Currently i am working with
scriptable objects and the class lists that contain them, person prefabs that are instantiated at runtime, addressables, a game controller, person manager, a ramen stand, and all the classes that go inbetween them. These are kept as Modular as possible

There's a lot of logic around the customers opinion of the ramen and the different factors that will affect it (ramen profile, ingredients, upgrades, etc). This will need balancing, but it looks good for now.

Future Plans.
